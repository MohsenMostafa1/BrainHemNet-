Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening medical emergency requiring rapid diagnosis. This paper presents BrainHemNet, a novel deep learning framework that automates the detection and precise segmentation of ICH in non-contrast head CT scans. Our method leverages the self-supervised visual features of DINOv3 for anomaly detection and the powerful zero-shot segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The pipeline first extracts rich feature representations from CT slices using a pre-trained DINOv3 model. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based anomaly detector is then trained on features from normal scans to identify deviations indicative of hemorrhage. Finally, the resulting anomaly heatmap is used to generate automatic prompts for SAM2, enabling precise pixel-level segmentation of the hemorrhagic region without any manual intervention. Evaluated on the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset, BrainHemNet demonstrates a robust ability to identify and segment hemorrhages, offering a significant step towards automated, explainable AI-assisted diagnosis in neuroradiology.
